## Community Guidelines
v20200613

We are a global community of developers, founders, designers, researchers, builders, thinkers, curious observers and market participants with a common interest in building a new future with decentralized technologies. Everyone comes from a different educational background and cultural context, which can create unique ideas but also occasional friction.  

This document lays out the culture we're hoping to achieve, the guidelines which underly it and the mechanisms we'll use on NEAR-owned channels to enforce it.

### Culture

Culture is the sum of all the subtle and not-so-subtle things a community does during the course of its engagement between members.  It is almost like the unspoken rules that everyone implicitly agrees to abide by.  Culture is stronger than active moderation — it is how members react to each other when no one else is watching.  Every single member is a creator and defender of the community's culture! 

The culture we'd like to achieve is:

1. **Welcoming** — anyone should feel comfortable lurking or participating, regardless of their background or skill level.
2. **Open** — all ideas should be considered on their merits and discussion should reflect open-mindedness.
3. **Inclusive** — people should feel encouraged to participate in discussion or projects because we're all in this together.
4. **Appropriately Challenging** — people should feel comfortable having their ideas challenged and should feel comfortable challenging the ideas of others, as long as it is in the well-intentioned search for the best solution. 
5. **Respectful** — No jerks or trolls. Everyone should feel treated respectfully and equally.  Words and actions should be thoughtful and should not create unnecessary emotional charge.  Peoples' time should also be respected.
6. **Positive and Fun** — people should feel encouraged to express their fun, creative and weird side because that's what makes this journey enjoyable.

### Guidelines

Culture is created over time by the actions of a group. These guidelines represent how we believe this culture becomes reality.

**Please do:**

1. Treat others online as you would treat them in real life;
2. Be tolerant towards other’s viewpoints; respectfully disagree when opinions do not align;
3. Respect the privacy and personal information of other contributors;
4. Communicate with courtesy and respect;
5. Provide accurate information, if you are not sure, please cross-check or contact someone from the Near team for support;

**Please do not:**

1. Make personal attacks on other community members;
2. Use defamatory remarks or make false statements against others;
3. Post prejudiced comments or profanity;
4. Post discriminating content;
5. Bully or make inflammatory remarks to other community members;
6. Shill projects to the community or post spam;

### Enforcement Policy

Culture is defined by the positive things members do and the negative things they actively prevent.  For those channels where NEAR team members and contributors are present, we commit to the following. We strongly suggest that anyone associated with the project will do the same in whatever channels they control:

1. **Ban and report trolls and spammers**.  No warnings will be given.
2. **Have zero tolerance for assholes**.  We will try to de-escalate situations but if someone appears to have disregard for the community values above, they will be banned. The community's energy is better spent working collaboratively than defusing arguments all day.
3. **Direct people to existing answers.** If you ask a basic question that is easy to Google or for which there is an answer written somewhere, you will be referred to those answers. Please don't take it personally, it is to help you learn and respect the community's time.

### Your Role

By being part of the NEAR community, we hope you will not just adhere to these guidelines but actively enforce them yourself.  Feel free to refer people to this document.  If you are a member of a NEAR channel (like Discord or Telegram), you will be held to these guidelines. 

Thank you for your participation and understanding.  Let's build a great community together!
