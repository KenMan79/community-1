## Security 

NEAR would ever reach out to you directly and ask you to send funds, share your login credentials, private keys, or other sensitive information.

If you came across vulnerabilities in our code, or you want to flag other security-related concerns, please follow the security protocol detailed [here](https://github.com/nearprotocol/nearcore/blob/master/SECURITY.md).

## Who we are?

Generally, we differentiate between three entities: The NEAR Protocol, the Near Foundation and Near Inc.

#### The NEAR Protocol
A permissionless, Proof-of-Stake blockchain protocol that anyone can access, add transactions to, or read from. The public NEAR blockchain is an instantiation of the reference code at http://github.com/nearprotocol/nearcore, but theoretically, this repo could be forked and deployed as a separate chain, as much as many protocols have done to build upon the core Bitcoin code.

#### The NEAR Foundation
A non-profit foundation headquartered in Switzerland, and is responsible for contracting protocol maintainers, funding ecosystem development, and shepherding core governance of the protocol.

#### Near Inc
A US-based software research and development company that did much of the early development of the protocol and its tooling. While Near Inc does not own or run the NEAR Protocol (which is decentralized), it continues to propose changes to the reference implementation codebase as one of multiple third-party entities performing R&D work for the protocol.
