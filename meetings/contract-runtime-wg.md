# Contract Runtime Work Group Agenda and Notes
This thread contains agenda and/or summary of the regular Contract Runtime sync meeting. Please propose agenda items through the PRs and Issues.

The scope of the contract runtime is the following:
* Wasm execution on the host:
  * Wasm VM and glue code around Wasmer+singlepass;
  * Code preparation tools, like gas injection and static checks;
  * Approaches to efficient caching of compilation;
* Gas metering:
  * How to make it faster while keeping safety;
  * Platform-independent gas fees estimation for Wasm operations;
* Host-guest interfacing:
  * How to pass complex structures efficiently between host and guest;
  * Contract-language specific mechanisms, e.g. Rust/AssemblyScript glue code needed to communicate across boundary;
* Rust/AssemblyScript to Wasm compilation:
  * Hiding low-level Wasm and glue code behind high-level contract interface. E.g. macros for Rust, compiler hooks for AssemblyScript;
  * Language-specific structure of the contract, how developers indicate contract methods, contract state, etc;
  * Best practices and the guidelines for contract development and compilation. Guidelines for optimizing contract for: Wasm size, gas usage, safety.

Short- and medium-term goal: Safe and highly performant contract execution runtime for Near;
Long-term goal: Near-independent and non-specific to Near contract execution runtime for general blockchains.
