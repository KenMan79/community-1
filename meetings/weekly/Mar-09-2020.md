## Announcements

### We must focus on stabilization and de-prioritize any non-critical efforts.
### New networks for devnet and betanet have been created.  More soon.

### Public Meeting Coordination

We are creating resources for public meetings, and the first step is using https://github.com/near/community.git for meeting agenda, joining info, announcements, and project coordination.  For monday development stand-ups, let's try to use this repo for the next few meetings.  Feedback much appreciated.
